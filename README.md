# CG1111A_A-MAZE-ING-RACE

Embedded Systems Project: Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and final report for my CG1111A project, “A-MAZE-ING RACE”. The goal of this project was to design and build an autonomous maze-solving robot using the mBot platform, various sensors, and custom-designed circuits.

## Platforms & Tools

Through this project, I learned to work with:
- The **mBot platform** as the robot base, with modular hardware for embedded systems prototyping.
- The **Arduino IDE** for programming the robot’s microcontroller.
- The **C++ programming language** for implementing sensor logic, control algorithms, and movement behaviours.
- Basic electronics tools (e.g., breadboards, resistors, wiring) and circuit design for integrating custom IR and LDR sensors with the robot.

## My Contributions

For this project, I was specifically in charge of:
- **IR and LDR Circuitry:** I helped design and build the infrared (IR) sensor circuit and the light-dependent resistor (LDR) circuit, which are critical for wall-following and colour detection.
- **LDR Casing Design:** I assisted in designing and implementing a light-shielding enclosure for the LDR sensor to reduce ambient light interference and improve colour detection accuracy.

## Team Contributions

Together, my team:
- Developed the full **autonomous navigation algorithm** for the mBot to solve the maze, detect walls and corners, and handle colour challenges.
- Designed and integrated **multiple sensors**, including ultrasonic, IR, and LDR sensors, with appropriate circuitry and shielding.
- Implemented a **PID control algorithm** for stable wall-following and accurate course correction.
- Wrote the Arduino-based source code for sensor integration, movement logic, and the celebratory sequence.
- Produced a detailed final report documenting the circuit design, algorithms, implementation details, challenges, and solutions.
